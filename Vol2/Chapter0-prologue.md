# Prologue

**[5 Days after Crux Interplanetary Liftoff]**

POV: Crux Admiral
:

{Its been 5 days since i departed from Serpulo, now that we lost Serpulo the Emperor gave me a new misson...}

{It seems we need to contact our Neighbors, the ***Malvis*** Clan.}

{I am sertain Sharded forces will attack the Malvis Clan as well, considering Erekir is right next to Serpulo, its the only reasonable conculusion.}

<"Notice: The Escape Shuttle will arrive at the destination 'Malvis Landing Site 012' in aproximitely 3 Minutes">

{It seems i will be landing sooner than expected...}

{They say Malvis Clan's Units are way more advanced than Crux Units but i heard their cost is incompareable to balance it out.}

"*Lets see how you will attack this time, Sharded...*"

The Doors opened as the Crux Admiral met a rather old looking Android, he was wearing a purple cape with thin gold lines as decoration. He had a sertain air to him, he seemed like the most important person in the area. He had a military hat that had a magenta colored star on it and 3 surge madals magneticaly placed on his chest. He was companied by several guards that all had the same military hat tho without the star. 
The Door fully opened as the old Android slowly aproached. 

"Nice to meat you, Crux Admiral 0-13" said the old Android, with a slow voice, while staring directly at the Admiral's eyes.

"Nice to meat you too, Captain of the 3rd Malvis Base, General Yukata."
